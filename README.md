# myfirstflutter

A new Flutter project.

## Description
This is my first attempt at a portfolio built using DART and Flutter. I started with just a single page with some basic text, and have since increased it to three pages with more text. Currently the page change isn't working correctly; the text on the screen is the button that changes it, and it will only lead you back to the first page. But as time goes on I will increase my knowledge of Flutter and DART and fix these issues while also learning new and exciting things to add to this project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
